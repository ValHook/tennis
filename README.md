# Tennis Roster Generator

## Running the generator

To use it on GitHub, [visit the site here](https://valhook.github.io/tennis/).

To use it locally, you will need to host it. The easiest way is by executing:

    python3 -m http.server

You can then visit your locally hosted instance at http://localhost:8000.

## Compiling

All code is in TypeScript. To compile it, execute `algorithm/compile.sh` (currently for Mac only).
